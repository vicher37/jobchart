Joining Visa was the worst career move ever in all my years of being in the workforce. I should have first seen the red flag when I waited more than a month\'s time for a background check clearance after my initial job offer at their onsite Career Fair. At their onsite Career Fair, I went through 2 interviews and passed 2 online tests. All on malfunctioning computers I might add. The whole Career Fair process was said to take only two hours, but it lasted six hours total where I didn\'t even have time for lunch. While waiting for my background check I never heard from anyone to confirm my employment. I called and emailed HR several times during the month but kept getting told that someone would call back with an answer. I received the call 3 days from when I was said to start. Upon recruitment they sell you on a dream marketing their company "perks" (ex. benefits, state-of-the-art facilities, foosball, ping pong tables, updated d\xc3\xa9cor and huddle rooms) as they try to compete with newer high tech companies, wanting to be an "employer of choice". You soon see through the fa\xc3\xa7ade within a day or so of walking through the hallways and quickly learn why when you toured the sterile facilities during Orientation, relax lounges stayed clean and empty. During break and lunch everyone hurries like animals to quickly, and quietly eat alone staying out of site. No one dares pick up ping pong paddles, touch the foosball tables, sneak out a chuckle or make possible eye contact with one another. Shower curtain covered Huddle rooms are used for fetal position hiding while talking silently on phones.<span class="review_more_link_container">\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0<a class="review_more_link" href="javascript:void(0);" rel="nofollow">more...</a></span><span class="review_more"> Mixes of shell shocked, stern faced robotic employees walk around as if someone constantly watches your every move through the cameras located all throughout the newly remodeled, state-of-the-art facilities.  Customer Service Associates are given 1.5 weeks of training then thrown deer-in-the-headlights confused at the front lines handling diverse customer service calls under strict compliance guidelines which upper management themselves are unclear and untrained to handle. In bound calls were either abusive or threatening from very angry customers who felt robbed of funds, or victimized elderly who simply didn\'t understand.  Asking help from upper management was not encouraged so no one dared ask for direction. Management constantly states they\'re all there to help support and guide you in succeeding but at the same time you know they\'re writing reviews, scrutinizing for every question asked and screw up made, just to have that one excuse to end your at will employment. No one wanted to hear your ideas. It\'s their way or the highway.  I feel pretty seasoned working in fast paced environments prior to Visa. But take note from Hunger Games because it\'s like never knowing who momentarily has your back, or ready to stab you for a power play on your job position.  It\'s simply a demoralizing environment where dumbing oneself down is the safe way to keep a job.  Hardest part of the job was just getting through each day waiting for the last hour to pass. Best part of the job was being able to walk out the door and breathe.  Even out of desperation don\'t even think about a possible employment with Visa. Stay away!\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0<a class="review_less_link" href="javascript:void(0);" rel="nofollow">less</a></span>
Focus on empowering of all individuals, clarity of purpose from management, talented people, always room to grow.  Reasonable work / life balance and plenty of training.  If you don't have a particular skill that is needed for a job, they get you the skills.
It was a good experience to work with this company, I am glad that I got a chance to be a part of the winning team. Thanks for all the support and guidance provided by the team.
Job was good but people were bad. Employees treat contractors like trash though most of the work is done by contractors. No job security or opportunities for growth(you will get fired if you talk about it). Difficult to drive on congested highways; nearest caltrain station is two miles away with limited shuttle services. Takes two to three hours to commute daily from south bay. Small cafeteria and very few restaurants within walking distance(no other option if take train or bus). No regrets getting out of this place.
Work provides good challenges with minimal supervision. Was assigned to a project written in a language, Python, that I had no previous experience.
the hardest part of my is work time, management is very easily done. co workers are so friendly.the most enjoyable part is friends at work.
Interesting place to be with so much going on in the payment space. You can have a good balance with work and family life. Lots of diversity. People are very friendly and great team culture.
A typical day at work was at least one person went home crying. What i learned is that tax season is the worst season. But if you have patience you will survive. Management.... My manager had no idea what we were working on, what she was doing, Nothing!. Running to the other side of the building to ask for help was horrible. The hardest part was everything. You had to fight for yourself.
Productive and comfortable workplace, Productive and comfortable workplace, Productive and comfortable workplace
Working at Visa was a great experience and really enjoyable to work for. They provided a good working environment and all the tools necessary to do my job.
I have a very good work/life balance at Visa, Inc. But I don't feel very motivated at work. I do my job and want to go home.
Worked in Loyalty program in Visa International. Worked with different loyalty programs such as VINCIR, TAQC, Sweepstakes. etc. VINCIR is an Incentive program with the objective of providing selected merchants the ability to have greater and more targeted access to selected Visa cardholders. TAQC is designed to provide benefits to cardholders in terms of loyalty point or cash back based on the norms defined as per the sponsoring organization.
Visa Inc., is a wonderful place to work. Worked there as a Consultant and a Permanent Employee on over several years. Worked in Customer Service, Product Office, and the VDPS team.
advancing projects is near impossible. direction by management is inconsistent if ever available.
Normally go in At 6:00 am and right when we hit the floor we start with the same thing every day. We start keeping attention to our applications to check that communications between issuers, acquirers and us are working properly.  Management is always behind scenes unless something goes wrong and not a lot of communication except via IM or emails. Co-workers are always very busy to interact with the others.  Last but not least and if any, the hardest part of the job is the long hours at the office and somehow the fact that we have no external light but understand that is because of security.
Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s about possible job duties, a potential start date or simply timing for the second interview, stressing your flexibility makes you easy to get along with.  Hiring managers don\xe2\x80\x99t like complications, and having to coordinate complicated schedules or haggle over a job description eventually just makes you look difficult. While you certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a pushover -- and \xe2\x80\x9cflexible\xe2\x80\x9d shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t define your salary negotiation -- show your potential employer that you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in results that work for everyone.
Visa is a very good company to work for IF you are in management. If you're unfortunate enough to be hourly, then you are just another replaceable number who can and will be let go for no warning or reason. The hardware and software you are expected to utilize is always broken and completely outdated. Which makes the daily overload of responsibilities impossible and punishment is fast and severe for falling behind. The environment is very hostile towards hourly employees as they talk about cutting the bottom line expenses to maximize profits, but the only people who seem affected, are the employees at the bottom of the food chain who actually do the work. Which is why the bonus structure and raise structure of management is closely guarded from hourly employees so they can't see just how badly they are being under appreciated and underpaid by comparison. The politicking that goes on at Visa is outrageous and blatant. They will reel you in with a decent enough starting pay as a CSR1, but then the raise structure after that is absurd. If you have the guts to approach HR about the immoral practices and favoritism, you'll find a final written warning with your name on it waiting for you, as Management looks after their own. If you enjoy being another completely replaceable number in an environment where people are commodities to be discarded for no reason, this is the place for you. Unless you can get on in a salary position, this is a horrific place to be employed. In talking to most other hourly employees, this is how they feel also, they are just too scared to say anything about it as reprisals are fast, severe, and final.
A place where hardwork, excellence and dedication results in the payment experience of the consumers.
Great Location super nice people beautiful buildings. I handled their Care Program contracting process.
Visa treats its contractors very pooly. I wonder what its like to be an employee?
Large company with mature business rules and resources, managers are seasoned, well-trained, usually got MBA from big universities.
During my time there I was able to quickly gain a lot of knowledge on many different aspects of the call center. There was a lot of room for growth for anyone willing to learn.
Visa was a great place to start my IT career. I was involved in different aspects of networking which helped me identify where I'd like to take my career path towards. The work atmosphere is fine, co-workers were very professional as well as the management. Days are very busy so time passes by fast for the most part.
I manage the alerts on Visa system. I analyze the issues and troubleshoot if need it. I escalate any issues to the appropriate department depending on the issue. Create incident for documentation purposes and contact client to address if any issues occur on our end.
A typical day at work often involved hitting the ground running, quickly prioritizing tasks for the day. I learned that I enjoyed the fast-paced environment while supporting a Senior Vice President and every detail of day to day operations for a larger team of 200 employees. I worked with a great group of people, many of whom became my friends. I looked forward to going to work and loved that the work allowed me to be creative, think outside the box, and collaborate with others daily. The hardest part of the job was taking on too much work at times and asking for help. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing a project knowing I gave it my all and met my deliverables with success.
very productive and a fun place to work at. Nice environment and excellent colleagues
Good company, lots of growth potential.*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Great salary &amp; benefits. I have enjoyed the time with this company. It has a great work/personal life balance
Awesome environment very mature processes employees are taken care of very well very good system
Good place to work if only you are serious with your work. You can climb high.
There are no typical days at work, as on any given day, I could be either in the office and at my desk, or half-way around the world in front of 25-30 banking professionals delivering a training class on Visa-specific information.  I learned a great deal about topics such as Visa Basics, Visa Operations, and Visa Disputes Management.  Management was remote as I was located in one office and my manager across the country in another.  I enjoyed my co-workers and loved my teammates  The hardest part of the job was managing my entire team through 12+ time zones.  The most enjoyable aspect was the learning environment and global travel opportunities that my job entailed.
I loved working here but had to move on to more challenging stuff.
Ejoyed working for company number one in the global marketplace.
Provided assistance to individuals with Visa cards. Handled disputes, lost or stolen cards. Activated and Deactived Visa cards
Visa is an ok place to work. It's a good place for career growth with a good employee base.
Great place to work. Friendly people, grow opportunity , good salary.
Visa had a very laid back environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the dress code which was casual that included jeans 7 days a week. Additionally, management trusted the staff- As long as your work was done and done to perfection it did not matter. It was a very interesting business to be able to see millions of Visa transaction run through the NOC every few seconds.
gained customer service experience, but the company overall was not a great experience.
Typical day: - 9:00 am to 5:00 pm flexible work hours with lots of fun in testing and coding  Learning experience: - managing people and spending quality time in ensuring best quality of product  Management: - difficult to transition to something new  Coworkers: - very productive and ever enthusiastic to help  Hardest part of job: - understanding people personality working on different domains  Most enjoyable part of the job: - Ever increasing appetite to testing and filing/fixing bugs in the payment domain. - Monitoring errors in case of existing code base changes.
Great work place and had a change to work on a very big environments.
I coordinate and do the promotions for all the Technical Focus Groups events and do the reporting.
a typical day at work what you learned management your co-workers the hardest part of the job the most enjoyable part of the job
Visa can trace its roots back to 1958, when the Bank of America launched BankAmericard, the first consumer credit card program available to middle-class consumers and small- to medium-sized merchants in the United States. It didn't take long for the company to grow; the company expanded internationally in 1974, followed quickly by the introduction of the debit card in 1975.  Two changes took place in the 1970s that defined our organization and reshaped an entire industry. First, BankAmericard became an independent entity that was eventually united under a common global brand \xe2\x80\x94 Visa. Second, Visa launched VisaNet, the world's first truly electronic authorization, clearing and settlement system, which enabled transactions to be completed in seconds.  These two milestones brought scale, security, reliability, and ubiquity to what was a fragile and fragmented business.
A typical morning at Visa Would be a confused an un-happy customer, This job can hurt your feelings if your not prepared I've seen agents run out because of their temper. My co-worker were very down to earth and funny, I love the environment . The hour breaks where amazing.
I worked as a customer service rep for a sesonal opportunity. My time there was as expected.
Visa employs many bright individuals who are dedicated to contributing to a engaging work environment.
As a global company at the forefront of the electronic payments industry, Visa is a dynamic organization. Those who are entrepreneurial and interested in seizing opportunities for growth and personal challenge will enjoy working at Visa, where innovation is not only the cornerstone of our culture but also our most powerful advantage in creating cutting-edge solutions.  While we value and reward innovation, we also value individual achievement. Compared with other global organizations, our relatively small size - approximately 7,500 employees worldwide - means that each employee's contributions can be more meaningful and visible.
I am habby working with Visa and participating in the latest 2 of Visa innovations of Visa Checkout (Digital Wallet) and Cloud Based Payments
The company has good benefits and advanced education program. Work/Life balance is good. Job security is bad since the new CEO came. Management sucks. The department I worked has lots of politics. People were competing each other instead of focusing on team work.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with politics and lack of trust. The most enjoyable part of the job is the good relationship with the stakeholders that I had supported and the contributions and changes I have made to the company.
Check daily schedule Check any important emails that need to reply. Data extraction and manipulation using SAS, Unix shell scripts, Hadoop map &amp; reducer, Python. Feature generation using XML.

work from home availabe. I have learned ETL, Banking card domain from Visa.
During my time with Visa, I worked in several departments including: Report Generating, Follow-Up, Data Management, and Operations Support. I have worked both on the forefront as a customer service rep as well as on the back end, entering data and updating the company's systems to business reporting at a high security level. I learned my work ethic from working for this structured company and attained several accomplishments while there.
Excellent people and products, fast pace environement and everyone cares about their jobs. Very dedicated team of people working together to exceed expecations.
amazing people to work with team work customer service to different people around the world
LAC office is growing, and is a nice place to work. All different functions from sales, finance and legal are present
I worked there as a temp, the group I worked in just keeps turning over and over. They won't promote from within, they hire for open positions externally, but that's fine the mgmt team there wants to keep it young with people that won't challenge them.  Not recommended if you're in a finance/accounting position, unless you want to remain there for life.
Great environment to work in. Encourages productivity. Excellent experience gained in payments industry.
Visa Inc. is a great company to work for and has great benefits. As a minority it is very challenging to have an opportunity for advancement.
I've worked for Visa International for five years. As a valuable employee this company had many ups and downs. The pay wasn't bad and benefits was great. The only issue was being a Customer Service Representative you can become burnt out due to being over worked and often you would have to keep putting in vacation requests which sometimes took awhile to answer back. The hours was great with occasional overtime which sometimes could be much or even having to do a earlier working shift to cover for other employees who didn't want do their jobs properly. Far as the corporate later goes you had to work for this company a very long time to reach the top which at some point people began to run out of patients and felt like they was going no were fast. Toward the end as I saw it coming they began to fully outsource their employees which means paying people who are half way around the world for less and no need for Americans. Which totally demeans the value of this company since being laid off and was offered to move with the company but no raise or bonuses enough to cover for the expense of moving. So in all if you sign up with this company be prepared for some challenges and sometimes cut throating to reach the top along with either going international or going to some state in America were things are more expensive.

Good company, always enjoyed working at this company. Good team of professionals.
Great environment. Diversity. Global Call Center Service.
Very poor compensation to developers. Simple task gets very complicated because of processes involved.Nothing is free. Not even drinks. Only good thing is pride of working for VISA.
I had multiple hats in this company from programmer to Database administrator. I enjoyed interfacing the Nursing staff doing the Medical Reviews accessing there Data.
work closely with the product managers, developers and QA.
Good company to work with. Management is helpful and become good mentor. Team is helpful.
Waiting for a inbound call. To have a lot of patience with clients. Management is very knowledgeable. Coworkers are fun to be around with. To have constant conversation with clients. Get to solve clients problems.
This is the company by which all others are measured. From the state of the art equipment to the process used to help the client everything is tip top professional. I enjoyed that professionalism.
As an events planner, my day-to-day responsibilities included project management of event program elements and logistics for various corporate events. In such a large company, I learned how to work re efficiently with cross-functional teams all over the company and was exposed to various levels of management. The challenges of the job included the heavy internal processes and bureaucracy within the company that sometimes hindered the productivity of our project teams.
Visa is one of the best employers in bay area. Proper work load, good management team and co-workers in friendly working environment.
FP&amp;A never has a predictable day at any company, and Visa is no exception. I learned a great deal about the payments space, and had very nice co-workers. Extremely collaborative culture, the downside of which was that decision making was sometimes slow to ensure all parties were on board. My biggest concern is there is a lack of strategic vision currently which will begin to show up over time unless addressed.
good mangement and team. Always focused on latest technologies Learned new skills
The experience is what you make of it. Good everything can be great if initiative is taken. Good salaries &amp; benefits, advancement opportunities for those that buddy up to the right people. All in all, its a sound place to participate, grow and develop.
Challenging work enviornment, interesting market, lots of smart people. Change is slow Career advancement is based on popularity- not skill.
It was a very senior position I held there and I enjoyed the experience given to me. I was fortunate that I had good bosses to work for
Fast paced and demanding environment. Globally distributed cross functional team.
Duties maintaining all aspects of 4 buildings (1,000,000 sq ft) operations including emergency generators; UPS\xe2\x80\x99s; VAV\xe2\x80\x99s; A/C\xe2\x80\x99s; Heat pumps cooling towers; electrical; plumbing; VFD drives; energy management systems; boilers; etc. I am a knowledgeable team player willing to assist, help, and train others. Coordinates daily operations and assists with supervision of personnel within assigned areas of service to ensure the building automation systems are running efficiently and effectively. Responsible for supervising the maintenance activities of personnel (5 Journeyman and 3 Building technician). Create and revise all operating and maintenance guidelines for the Maintenance &amp; Engineering Department. Participate and support the Director in development of the annual budget, including operational and capital budgets. Ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory guidelines, requirements, standards and codes required (EPA, OSHA, safety program, CFC handling, etc.) for the facilities and engineering department.

Manage contractors to ensure work is completed correctly, on budget and on time. Review, modify and write preventive maintenance standard operating procedures. Ensure that all scheduled and unscheduled work orders are completed in a timely manner and that all repairs, adjustments and replacement of equipment and components are documented in the IFAMS.
Look over your shoulder. Dont make any mistakes. Bad Management.
Depending on your position and department that you work in, Visa is a fast paced environment. You come to work and not play. Everyone is respectful and people friendly. Visa is diverse many different cultures to interact with. I learned about restriction and hidden fees on card, Visa the company is a transaction company visa does not issue credit cards. The hardest part of the job is the back to back calls without increasing your after call work time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the bonus and reviews
I was able to see Visa before and after it went public. Obviously, the higher up the chain, the more you get. That is understood and agreed. There was just a much bigger split after it went public. There were more and more Senior Business Leader positions created, and Head of ... positions, with more and more benefits for these positions. Their roles were not outsourced. Meanwhile, the lower positions had perks whittled away, and were the brunt of layoffs.
This is a good place to work short term but don't recommend it for long term. Their isn't many option to move up within the company and management isn't very professional.
Toxic environment, good brand  Good salary, benefits  Bureaucratic, slow moving, hard to get stuff done  Not a technology company
I worked for this company and I was very happy here, unfortunately the company closed and they had to let me go
Dealing with others on a regular basis. Required to learn all the subsystems, organize testing, and organize co-workers to create workable software.  Dealt with banks in Europe and frequently interacted with clients to update them and deal with concerns.
As an application manager i was responsible for a team of 15 - 30 application programmers. I worked on issues related to budgets, project management, corporate/government audits, resource planning, meeting project deliverables, monitoring project status, personnel issues, management reporting, formal and informal staff performance appraisals, and more.  The hardest part of the job was navigating the political management environment.  The technical staff were very capable and competent.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the staff to accomplish and deliver projects on schedule and within budget.
The working environment is ver competitive. Had the chance to work with some of the most technically gifted people.
I collaborated in the invention of a versioning algorithm that save Visa tens of thousands of dollars, which included development, analysis, and implementation costs.
Handled an average of 80 calls a day (inbound and outbound calls).
This was a great job to learn about call centers and gain the experience that motivated me to want this as a career
Awesome Management  most enjoyable part was helping account holders with everyday credit issues
Good company to work with. Good work culture. Nice initiatives , good management

I like the skills they provided me with during my contract. A great place to come into work everyday. Employees work very hard but it is a fun and exciting environment to be a part of.
Provided support to customers after hours and on weekends. Resolved problems efficiently and professionally by applying knowledge of software, applications, and hardware
great benefits awesome place to work, manager are really helpful
talking on the phones all day good management fun people to work with repetitive good hours/benefits
Great work life balance, flexible work environment, more conservative but fun
A typical day at work consisted of epic teamwork. Team members pulled together to help with work load so that everyone can leave on time at the end of the day. My manager was a great influence for the prepaid department. She made sure all of her employees were taken care of and had an open door policy. Communication was welcoming and we had weekly meetings to make sure everyone was on the right track. In the 14 months I have worked there, I have learned 4 other positions and I was grateful for the experience. The most enjoyable part of the job, is getting to know everyone in my department as well as others and working as a team to get the job done.
working with visa was good experience for me. i learned to work with over 100+ coworkers to me time went by fast some manager wasnt so understand but sometime they will work with u. the hardest part was when it was time to go to lunch u have 30 mins to eat and i was pregnant lol .
I have enjoyed my 4 years at Visa, Inc. Typical work day involves working on process related projects within our division, tracking our work within our corporate systems, reaching out to folks for planning sessions on different project activities. The management at Visa has been great - very good working relationship with my direct manager the entire 4 years. Hardest part of the job is the constant "marketing" we have to do to promote our department, services and value.
Visa is going through it\'s fourth re-organization in the last couple of years, and in turn moral is low.  The people are smart. But there is no "team" work.
employer had great benefits &amp; incentives: 401k, stocks, cash rewards, &amp; corporate perks/benefits... made great friends
I loved my time at Visa. It is an amazing place to work. While the company trends toward multiple reorgs, the practice reflects senior management's desire to improve the organization, continually striving to increase performance and decrease costs while creating an excellent environment for employees, consultants, and customers alike.
Small office of five employees, hardly feels like work. Too small for long term employment.
Great benefits, good work life balance. Good work ethics. Good environment.
I was able to implement several sustainable practices at the Highlands Ranch office. The culture was fun, fast and I learned many things about both the information technology industry and about Facilities.
A true global operation that toucheds the daily lives of most people in the face of the earth than any other I have been associated with. Your work there really means something. Will like to get back in the future.
A typical work day for me was working in a deadline driven environment. I knowned how to listen and understand the customer need. Also how to relate to the customer and most importantly I learned how to be patient. Management was okay, they were willing to listen to your idea and inpute. My co-worker were harding working and willing to lean a hand when you need help. I enjoyed talking to customer and assisting their need.
This position requires excellent exceptional verbal and written communication skills with a comprehensive understanding of the cardholder dispute process, card processing, the bankcard industry, Visa\xe2\x80\x99s Operating Regulations, and the arbitration and compliance process.

In the four years I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked at Visa, I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned a lot about the financial and bankcard industry. In addition, I\xe2\x80\x99ve become a SME for Visa Operation Regulations and have become the go to person for my team. I\xe2\x80\x99ve lead many projects and trained JR staff members on Visa International Operating Regulations.
Like most any other professional work place, when the industry is up the environment is also up, when the industry is in turmoil - so is the environment on the job. If one can bend in the wind of the swings they can do well here.
Great working environment.  Was able to work in many departments within visa as part of Project Management assignments
I was able to learn a lot from different departments I was able to work with. Too bad that I was only a temporary person for so long.
Visa was a very great team to be apart made me feel like I was at home.
Visa offers very good benefits to its employees. The work load was ok. but you won't see cutting edge technology over there.
with its volume of calls in the help desk you barely could get up to take a quick break but it was a good job
We usually have to be at our work station and just wait for the incoming calls.  It was alwas fun helping customers
I felt like they were a good company to work for and had fun working seasonal for them.
It was a good experience for my call center job. I liked inbound call center environment.
Excellent people to work with, very highly skilled. Uses great technologies, a bunch of great software products and is all over the globe. Very intersting business model.
It was a beautiful experience where there was opportunity to grow but the company closed
My time with Visa was definately a great experience. I not only was selected to Relocate with the call center from Baltimore to Miami, but I was cross-trained, promoted, and assisted in training several departments including: General Customer Service, Follow-Up, Report Initiation, Data Management, and Operations Support. My versatility in these roles have given me a great skill set to use in future endeavors.
Good place to work and great brand name for your resume. Not much work /life balance as its a finance company
Working at VISA was an amazing experience, a great place to learn and add more underneath your belt.

The company was fun to work for. A normal day was filled with fun, laughter, and angry customer. I leaned that keeping yourself calm is the best way to resolve any issue. The hardest part of the job was, dealing with the mass amounts of calls that came in everyday. My manager was great at keeping every one happy and going smooth. My coworkers where probably one of the best parts of the job
1. Very busy days 2. Getting information can be challenging 3. Providing excellent service is most enjoyable part of my job
Interned in Finance Controllership Department -great training program: many individual overviews given by higher managements -very welcoming managers/ cowokers -very rewarding intern-only events: breakfast/lunches with executives, including CFO, CTO etc every/ every other week
Great culture and work style - although this was Pre-ipo days.
Once upon a time, it was a wonderful place to work but now it's, ugh ugh ,ugly with constant infighting. Visa has changed for the worse over the last few years with never ending rounds of layoffs at the end of each quarter. There is little team building, since you never know if you will have a team there to work with when people you are counting on are suddenly gone,There are still some great people and products but the current CEO and his executive management team is killing off the spirit of what made Visa great.
I learned a lot about managing multiple projects and shifting timelines; also worked with several remote teams.
A typical day at work is spent makinsuppose calls, preparing spreadsheets and customer/client follow-ups. Co-Workers are diverse and very easy to work with.
Stay away from Visa. It is a big bureaucratic machine that will kill any creativity that you might have. I suspect that within 5 years, or so it will be an irrelevant 'also-run', not a leader as it's been for too long.
Visa was a good company to work for but Sr. Management was difficult.
From the working environment to management this is a top notch employer. The turnover rate is high only due to the loss and acceptance of new clients by the company. Once a contact is fulfilled with a client most employees hired for the client will have to be release and only a small fraction stay if any.
The job is fun. The people are great. Be focused with your job. You learn alot about the card processing.
